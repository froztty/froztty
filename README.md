## About me üßç‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Been a gamer since 2010 and have been hooked in ever since! I enjoy playing on the computer and because of that grew a passion that was strong enough to take Computer Science as my major. üò≠ However, it was the best decision I made and have grown a new passion in software development as I learn more about the technology behind computers. I love programming with Python to create personal projects like a Discord Bot that helps with scheduling your events for a group of people. There is a lot to do when it comes with being in the CS field and one of my interests is CNO development.
