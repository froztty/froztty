## About me 🧍‍♂️
Been a gamer since 2010 and have been hooked in ever since! I enjoy playing on the computer and because of that grew a passion that was strong enough to take Computer Science as my major. 😭 However, it was the best decision I made and have grown a new passion in software development as I learn more about the technology behind computers.
